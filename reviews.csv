These are much older iPads, so be mindful of that. I received 2 beautifully working older devices at an excellent price. A lot of popular apps don’t work on these any more, so you can’t expect to do the same you do on an older device. These really are only really good as a tablet for a very young child to use, or to use for reading, browsing the Internet or listening to music only. A lot of the other functionalities will malfunction.

The system is packaged so well and everything you need is provided. It's so easy to setup through the app and in no time my whole monitoring system is set up. The hub is very nice looking and will go with many decors. The siren is very loud and will surely scare off any intruder. The keypad has nice big buttons that are easy to read and it also lights up when in use.

However, there is not an option to have user codes. Everyone uses the same disarm code so you have no logging. You can't add another user to receive the notifications on their phone. No permissions

Other odd things, you can only have notifications for sensors on or off. I don't want sensors buzzing me that I'm home when the alarm isn't set. 

When setting it to home/stay mode, such as going to bed or whatever, it has a 60second exit delay that you cannot change. Why? Also it beeps very loudly the entire countdown waking everyone up. Even the neighbors hear it. Why? Seems not well thought through.

I have not had the best experiences with laptops in my life, but that changed when I used the HP Elite Dragonfly G3. Going over the pros, talking about performance, this laptop exceeded my expectations. It takes no time in starting up, transferring files, and just doing overall computer trasks. The laptop also has really nice audio and video, which I have not experienced in a laptop before. The screen quality is excellent, to see this type of quality in a laptop blows me away. The two biggest things that captured my attention was the touch screen display, and the fingerprint unlocking feature. The overall design of it is also nice, it is very sleek, compact, and easy to carry around with me.

There are also a few cons that came with the HP Elite Dragonfly G3 as well. When I first used the laptop, there were many many updates that took a while to figure out, download, and install. It seemed as if the updates were nonstop, but doesn't affect performance whatsoever. Another thing that has troubled me is how the laptop gets a bit hot from the underside, and the charger box itself. The fan then gets a bit loud trying to cool down the laptop, I think. This concerns me a bit, but it does not affect performance either. Lastly, I mentioned the fingerprint unlocking feature in the pros, but the one con of it is that I have had to reset my fingerprint twice because the laptop wouldn't recognize it, but it has been working over the past two weeks.

Overall, this laptop is a great, fast, sleek, and smooth laptop that has exceeded my expectations for a laptop.",5,2022-10-04 00:00:00,2023-07-14 15:34:18

Goodbye monitor stands! Now I can separate them, put them together, turn them 90 degrees, raise or lower them. Bring them closer... whatever I want really. And everything I do with them affects nothing on my desk.
                    You will need some room behind your desk for the arms, but not too much (I had to pull my desk from the wall a few inches). Otherwise, a high quality device that is totally worth every penny.
                    4 stars because no matter how hard I pushed, one of the arms simply would not sit flush on one of the two pegs on the desk clamp. The other one slid perfectly but this one left about a half inch of silver post showing. I even removed the tightening screw and it still wouldn't push down. However, it did not affect usage so I kept it and chose to live with it. My focus isn't on that area anyway. And as long as it does what it's supposed to do, I'm happy. I think my setup just has a small manufacturing defect and I can't imagine it's like this with every kit. This is a high quality device that will probably last 20 years or more. By then, we'll all have lightweight virtual reality glasses. But until then, I highly recommend these for your monitors.
                    I'm sporting two 21"" Asus monitors. The screws were in the right place and the installation was simple. Very happy with purchase.",4,2020-05-04 00:00:00,2023-07-14 15:34:18

They constantly have connectivity issues, one ear bud cuts out when I turn my head one way, turn my head the other way and same thing.

The TV seems to be heavy to carry for level 2 residents. Excited about our 55inch TV. While unboxing the TV, found that it has a stunning thin profile for an OLED TV, the screen is thinner than any smartphone on the market. The screen does have a Wow factor to it. The TV is included with a Stand, with 2 feet that should be screwed into the base of the TV screen. Once we set up the TV with the stand, it looks like a very smart tv with an extremely thin screen, bazel free, mirrors effect, and anti-glare coating. The picture quality of the OLED TV is stunning .. didn't disappoint me for movies and binge series watching. The remote control is fine and has all the required buttons to navigate through. The audio has stereo speakers built-in, and they're relatively good for movies and binge series watch. We can sync the TV to the soundbar if needed as well. There are 3 HDMI cable ports for this TV.

The most noticeable thing when unboxing the TV was the thinness of the screen and how LG has found a way to shrink the electronic component footprint on the OLED TVs.
The screen is impressive to look at out of the box, and once you have it powered on, it's just jaw-dropping. Everyone who has seen this TV in my home has mentioned it makes you feel like you're immersed in whatever is on the screen. 
The OLED technology is impressive, and LG seems to keep things exciting in their OLED lineup. As a person who loves movies, video games, and sports, this TV has made me enjoy all my old movies again with its 4K upscaling ability.
As for hardware mounting compatibility, the TV includes 2 feet if you choose to use it on a stand, or it can mount on a VESA compatible bracket. The remote control is a slightly revised version of the traditional LG bracket remotes. Though it looks like more of a traditional remote, it still has the pointer on-screen feature support. 

The built-in sound is excellent and can be enhanced by connecting to a Bluetooth soundbar or a surround sound setup. With the ARC HDMI support, this TV provides an enjoyable visual and audio experience.

Below are a few things wish it had and highlights I'm enjoying.


I wish it had:
-One more HDMI port for a total of 4

-Having the vesa mounting holes a bit more center of the screen and not near the bottom.

Highlights:
-The colors are amazing
-Game mode
-Setup was simple

For starters the entire bezel of the TV frame is extremely thin, just like today's high end smartphone! Which allows for a much more immersive view of the 55"" 4K vivid display.  First time set-up and configuration of the TV was easy and straight forwards but also allowed for ease of customization  for flexibly! Secondly out of the box the SmartTV comes with dozens of ready to use  apps and  internet streaming services, That doesn't require any additional attachments or boxes. Which is very convenient such as  Prime video is is my primary movie and TV streaming app!  Thirdly, sound quality is superior, loud, very crisp and distinct that captures fine details and sounds, creating a much more in-depth TV experience similar to a movie theater! Lastly, the AI features/ intelligence and magic remote function for LG SmartTV series continues to excel a provides an excellent user experience and allows for effortless navigation.

The OLED A1 55 inch TV is a perfect TV for anyone looking for a great OLED TV at a price that doesn't make you squirm. It lacks some features that the C1 and G1 TV's have, but knowing the limitations going into the purchase, I am perfectly fine with any limitations it has to its bigger brothers. Most notably, the panel is a native 60 Hz, so if you're looking to pair this with a Xbox Series X or a PS5, you won't get 120Hz gaming, and if that's important, you should look at the C1. 

The build quality is on par with other LG OLED TV's, and aside from the stand, I believe the TV chassis is the same as the C1 series., which is to say it's great.

This is a secondary TV that is in my master bedroom, and for that purpose is knocks it our of the park. The colors are spectacular, contrast impeccible. It supports HDR and Dolby Vision, and it really shines in these areas. Because it's OLED, blacks are completely black, so contrast is amazing. This especially compared to my 75 inch Nanocell in my main family room that has a full array dimming LED backlight. The Nanocell isn't bad, but it's not in the same area code as far as contrast goes. It's just that good. The LG magic remote is spectacular, and has been modified from last year's model which I have with the Nanocell. In all honesty, I prefer the previous remote for one reason. They removed the dedicated play/pause buttons on the new model, and I constantly find myself trying to use them when they aren't there.

The smart features of the TV are as good as any other LG smart TV, which is to say awesome! Lots of app support including the staples like Netflix and Disney+ as well as apps like Plex. The built in speakers are a bit weak, which is where it's good that the SPY8A soundbar was included in the bundle. This complements the TV well, and with both being LG, they work in unison, and integrate seamlessly. I control both with the magic remote. The TV can connect wirelessly over bluetooth, but I prefer wired connection over HDMI for improved audio clarity from the TV using E-ARC.

All in all, this TV is highly recommended if you can do with a 60 Hz panel, and one less HDMI port than the C1. Other than that it's nearly perfect.",5,2021-07-14 00:00:00,2023-07-14 15:34:18
